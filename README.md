## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer living in Germany.

## Projects

Currently, I am following online courses on Generative AI and MLOps tools. As I follow along, I plan to share some of my projects here:
- [What to watch tonight?: A recommender system](https://github.com/gekinci/movie_recommendation)

Here is a project I worked on as part of a hiring process:
- [From Image To Diagnosis: An ML Pipeline](https://github.com/gekinci/histoGPT_pipeline)
